# Enpublica data connector for Power BI
A custom Power BI Data Connector for the St. Louis Federal Reserve (FRED) and U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) database

### Summmary
The Enpublica data connector provides easy access to over 1 million economic and energy-related time series directly in Power BI.  In addition to simple time series (i.e. date/value), the FRED and EIA databases also expose a variety of multidimensional datasets.  Finally, the connector exposes a small but growing set of supplemental datasets directly from Enpublica - including older historical data and a custom date dimension.
